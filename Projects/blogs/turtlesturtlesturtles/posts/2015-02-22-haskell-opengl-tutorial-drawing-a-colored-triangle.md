#### Haskell OpenGL Tutorial: colored triangle.

\
Credits:

I would like to thank [Sven Panne](https://github.com/svenpanne )
for providing valuable advice on OpenGL statefulness
as well as creating a great set of [examples](https://github.com/haskell-opengl/GLUT/blob/master/examples/RedBook8/Chapter01/Triangles.hs).
Without his work, this set of tutorials may not be possible,
parts and bits of ios source code is used in various shapes and forms throught these pages.

Sven has recently uploaded a bare-bones [vertex-color triangle example](https://github.com/haskell-opengl/GLUT/tree/master/examples/Misc/ColorTriangle)
Somebody may find it more useful to follow, because in this tutorial the code related to vertex colors is coupled with NGL.
