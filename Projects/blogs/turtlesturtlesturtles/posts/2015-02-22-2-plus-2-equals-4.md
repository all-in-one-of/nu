3 laws of enquiry:
\
1. Always to separate sharply the psychological from logical, the subjective from the objective; \
2. Never to ask for the meaning of the word in isolation, but only in the context of a propositon; \
3. Never to loose sight of the distinciton between concept and object.\
\
(from Shroder) "Abstract number, then, is the empty form of difference."\

"Hardly anything more unfortunate can befall a scientific writer than to have one of the foundations of his edifice shaken after the work is finished. This was the position I was placed in by a letter of Mr. Bertrand Russell, just when the printing of this volume was nearing its completion."\
